This causes the device to vibrate when you interact with the app. This permission is automatically given by the device and (depending on phone model) may not be able to be revoked by the user.

- "android.permission.NOTIFICATIONS" = This permission is used to create and manage notifications in android versions older than android 13 (API level 33), the permission is granted automatically (However by default turned off in the app settings) and can be easily revoked in your phones settings.
